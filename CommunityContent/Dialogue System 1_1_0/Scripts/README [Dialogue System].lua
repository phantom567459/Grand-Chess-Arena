Hello there.

Who wants to read a very long text file of how to use this system?  Not me.  So I spent quite a few hours writing
nice documentation that was easy to follow for those getting started.  Also contains a "Quick Start" guide for those
that just want to get straight in and use the system.

If you don't want to read all the documentation, then I would recommend checking out the examples that come with it, that
way you can get a very good idea how to setup dialogue for your own characters.  I would definitely checkout the Advanced
Example to see a lot of the features.

Examples Tip:
	For the examples drop the "Dialogue System" into your hierarchy, then drop the example you want to try out also into
	the hierarchy.  Next, expand the example folder and drag the "Dialogue System Database" folder onto the "database" property on the
	"Dialogue System" folder.  

	For the Advanced Example, you should turn on Player Storage, or you will receive an error in the Event Log.  This is
	because it's a full example that uses resources (coins, and various food that can be purchased from a stall).

Here's a highlight of some of the features:

 - No code solution for branching dialogue with player choices.
 - Easy to visualise the conversation by looking at the hierarchy tree for the character conversation.
 - A few themes inspired by other games (not 100% identical).
 - Easy to customise the dialogue for your own game.
 - Advanced features for more experienced users (callbacks, conditions, events)
