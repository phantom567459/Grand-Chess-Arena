The Chess Hub
To Fix:
--trigger recognition was broken on reload.  must be server error, didn't clear someone out of queue?
	--fixed 7/6

--Make tutorial obvious on load (cinematic?)
	--Move tutorial man to the park
	-->done 7/6
	--Add to Tutorial!
	
Future fixes
--Lock Camera using button
--Professional area?  (I was thinking this more for the tournament
--Spectator Mode!!
--Extra Camera adjustments
--better board visual cues (Check,player turn, etc.)
--code optimization for 16 boards
--Maybe add a button to finish the game?
--Game storage, what can we do?
--Curves for moving the pieces (instead of 2 move to's)
--Timers!
--Chess Puzzles
--Position/Game of the week (PGN imports?)

--I've noticed when i just keep mashing I can override the turn checker
---->On top of this I need extra checks on the server for player turn, in case the client gets confused
---->EXTRA CODE CHECKS FOR LEGALITY (someone brokey and captured their own piece)
----FIXED 8/9/21 by adding server side checks that stop the player that sent bad turn data
