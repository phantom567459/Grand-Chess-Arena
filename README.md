# Grand-Chess-Arena
Creating a functional Chess Tournament Setup in Core Games

The idea initially and what I'm working on at the moment is to have a completely functional chess board that can be used in CC (and a checkerboard). Then we'll configure the Arena setup as a Swiss System tournament that X amount of players can join in on the fun.

Included will be: Spectator Mode (2D), some form of rating system, storage of other statistics.
