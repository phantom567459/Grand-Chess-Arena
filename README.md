# Grand-Chess-Arena
Creating a functional Chess Tournament Setup in Core Games

The idea initially and what I'm working on at the moment is to have a completely functional chess board that can be used in CC (and a checkerboard). Then we'll configure the Arena setup as a Swiss System tournament that X amount of players can join in on the fun.

Included will be: Spectator Mode (2D), some form of rating system, storage of other statistics.

Edit: Since this project has no longer been in active development for some time and I'm not a fan of the direction Core Games has went recently (and thus don't see myself continuing), I've made this project public as of 9/7/2022.  I'm not sure this is the final code for what is still registered as "Grand Chess Arena" in Core.  Use as you see fit, please just credit me (Dark_Phantom) or any of the other creators noted.
